shutterfingers
==============

Listen to remote shutter signals on an EOS-stype 2.5mm TRS input (http://www.doc-diy.net/photo/eos_wired_remote/) and operate a servo to mechanically depress the shutter button for cameras that don't support such remote control.

[Version 1](https://github.com/misterbisson/shutterfingers/releases/tag/1.0) and earlier were written for ATmega328 and ATmega32U4 Arduino environments (the classic Arduino Uno and Leonardo, and similar).

Later versions are refactored for ATtiny85 running on a [Digispark board](http://digistump.com/products/1), because anything bigger is overkill. Also, because it's way cheaper.
