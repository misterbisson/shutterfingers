Digispark.fzpz is pretty well hidden on the internetz. I’ve included a copy here, but it was originally downloaded from [an attachment](https://fritzing.googlecode.com/issues/attachment?aid=27530005000&name=Digispark.fzpz&token=xr4y_1Nh8ppIkeAgg_UClL5JRy8%3A1385007063290) to [an issue](https://code.google.com/p/fritzing/issues/detail?id=2753) in the Google code repo for Fritzing and hasn’t yet been added to the core parts library.
