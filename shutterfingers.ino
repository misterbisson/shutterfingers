shutterfingers

Positions a servo to depress the shutter button of a camera when triggered
from a remote shutter release cable. See URL below for pinouts:
http://www.doc-diy.net/photo/eos_wired_remote/

This code is written for ATtiny85 running on a Digispark board.
See http://digistump.com/products/1

Version 1 of the project can was written for a more common ATmega328
or ATmega32U4-powered Arduino environment. It's still available from:
https://github.com/misterbisson/shutterfingers/releases

The ATtiny85 differs in a number if ways from ATmega328 and ATmega32U4 environments.
These two pages offer detail some of those differences:
https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/tiny-avr-programmer-hookup-guide/attiny85-use-hints
http://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/basics

Regarding pins and pull-up (pullup) resistors on the Digispark and ATtiny85:

Quoting from http://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/basics :

	"Pin 3 (P3) has a 1.5 kÎ© pull-up resistor attached to it which is required for
	when P3 and P4 are used for USB communication (including programming). Your design
	may need to take into account that you'd have to overpower this to pull this pin low."

	"The internal pull-up resistor are much weaker (about 25 kohm) on an ATtiny
	than on an Arduino, so the onboard LED interferes with them. If you need them,
	you can use a different port. Change your circuit to not need the internal
	pull-up, or cut the LED trace."

And because I think there are some typos in the above description about using
the the internal pull-ups, I used the example in http://digistump.com/board/index.php/topic,1086.msg4553.html#msg4553
when implementing them in this project.
